<h2>Show Field and Exhibition Classes</h2>
				</div>

				<div class="content_entrybody">
				<p>So as <acronym title="dubs in the valley">DIV</acronym> continues to grow, we have decided to bring back the exhibition class. This class is open to all makes/models/vehicles. Basically, if it has a motor in it, it's welcome. So if you want to show your ride but it's not a VW or Audi, don't worry, go right ahead and register for the Exhibition Class and we'll get ya taken care of.</p>
				
				<p>We're always trying to come up with new ways to help improve the show and everyone's experience, so this year we'er doing something new for the Show Field, we're doing away with individual classes. So if you're in a VW or an Audi, just register for "Show Registration" and you'll be in the main show field. </p>
